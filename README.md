# Text-classification-of-a-movie-dataset

## Approach 
- Data gathering: Access the data source and download the data. 
- Text preprocessing: removing punctuations (. , ! $( ) * % @ ), removing URLs, removing Stop words, lower casing, tokenization, stemming, lemmatization - Data visualization: word cloud 
- Data modeling: Machine learning classification techniques

## Methodology
- Different performance metrics were carried out to determine the best machine learning classifier for sentimental analysis of text.
- The accuracy of the performance analysis was determined for different machine learning classifiers.
- Sentimental analysis was performed to classify text into positive or negative categories.

## Conclusion 
- The project identified the most effective machine-learning classifier for text sentiment analysis.
